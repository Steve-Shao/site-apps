# Illinois Vehicle Services Locator

Interactive maps of official Illinois emission testing centers and vehicle registration locations.

## 🔍 About

This site was created to solve a common problem: finding the nearest emission testing center or vehicle registration location in the Chicago area. While official information exists, it's often presented as text-only listings, making it difficult to quickly find the closest location. This interactive map-based solution makes the process simple and intuitive.
